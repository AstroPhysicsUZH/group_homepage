(STE-QUEST) is a candidate mission for a M launch opportunity in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme.

The mission is designed to answer a range of questions in fundamental physics by performing precision measurements with high accuracy atomic sensors.

In particular, STE-QUEST would test Einstein's Equivalence Principle, which underpins the theory of General Relativity; explore the boundaries with the quantum world; and search for new fundamental constituents and interactions in the Universe.
