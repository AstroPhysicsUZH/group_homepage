Our research area focuses around Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR). Even though being a very successful theory in explaining the universe at the large scale, a few open questions remain, especially in small spacetime regions where it cannot be unified with quantum field theory. We do the theoretical work for tests of GR, that could allow to find deviations and would be a motivation to formulate a more general theory, unifying all fundamental forces of nature.

We are involved with several international research projects:
eLISA (Consortium Steering Commitee) https://www.elisascience.org
LISA Pathfinder (Science Team) http://sci.esa.int/lisa-pathfinder/
STE-QUEST (Study Science Team) http://sci.esa.int/ste-quest/
E-GRIP (Principal investigator)

We are part of the physics institute of University of Zurich UZH. Our offices are located at the beautiful Irchel campus in Zurich and can be found in the <strong>building 36 on the K floor</strong> <a href=”https://www.google.ch/maps/place/Physik-Institut+der+Universit%C3%A4t+Z%C3%BCrich/@47.397124,8.5498869,305m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x479aa08286159ca7:0x472b412a88eb77a6!6m1!1e1”>(directions)</a>





In this function, we have many collaborations



Our goal is to prepare tests of GR with 

 GR and use it to make predictions about the universe.
